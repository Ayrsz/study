# My Learning Journey: Tech Study Repository 🚀

Welcome to my personal study repository! This project is dedicated to practicing and mastering various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. Instead of being a single finished product, it serves as a "living" documentation of my progress and technical skills.

## 📌 Objective
The main goal here is **continuous learning and training**. Each directory contains exercises, small projects, or implementations designed to solidify my understanding of the technologies listed below.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Directories

### 💜 Haskell
- **Focus:** Functional programming concepts.
- **Content:** Logic exercises, recursive functions, and type definitions.

### ☕ Java
- **Focus:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Clean Code.
- **Content:** Practical implementations of core Java features.

### 🧠 PyTorch
- **Focus:** Deep Learning and Neural Networks.
- **Content:** Model training, tensors, and experimentation with AI architectures.

### 🖼️ Image Processing (Processamento de Imagem)
- **Focus:** Computer Vision and Digital Image Manipulation.
- **Content:** Filters, transformations, and analysis using Python and specialized libraries (OpenCV/PIL).

### 🧪 Pytest (Work in Progress)
- **Status:** ⏳ *Planned / To be updated*
- **Focus:** Automated testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). 
- **Note:** I am currently revisiting these concepts to upload high-quality examples soon.

### ⚡ FastAPI (Work in Progress)
- **Status:** ⏳ *Planned / To be updated*
- **Focus:** Building high-performance APIs with Python.
- **Note:** Files will be uploaded once I conclude my current review of the framework.

### 🐙 GitHub
- **Focus:** Version control and workflow optimization.
- **Content:** Best practices for Git, Branching, and Repo management.

## 📈 Evolution
This repository is updated as I advance in my studies. The folders for **Pytest** and **FastAPI** are placeholders for upcoming content as I re-study and refine my knowledge in these areas.
